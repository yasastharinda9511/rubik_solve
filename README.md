# rubik_solve

# Introduction

This project is implemented during my two weeks of end of semester 2 vacation. This algorithm based on
the very beginner approach of solving rubik's cubic called as the white cross method. My algorithms is not 
powerful as the modern machine learnng based approaches. It takes minimum 100-120 moves to solve the rubic cubic.
I will expect to develop this algorithm within my Uni life. 
I tested that algorithm for nearly 40-50 permutations which is able to solve 95% times.

My rubic cube solving algorithm based on this [web page](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/)

All the standards are defined according to the data provide that [web page](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/how-to-solve-the-rubiks-cube-beginners-method/)
